#+TITLE: Clojure

* Beginning Stages?
** Day 1
- Watched [[https://youtu.be/m0rSJ9xdsdk][Interactive Programming for Artificial Intelligence - Dragan Djuric]]
  - Subscribed to the books and will be spending some time to follow them
- Watched [[https://youtu.be/bEOOYbscyTs][Clojure is Not Afraid of the GPU - Dragan Djuric]]
  - Massive speed ups
- Did 4clojure 26 - Fibonacci
  - Still trying to wrap my head around the solution
** Day 2
- Midway through Casting SPELs in LISP (Clojure Lisp Version)
  - Finally getting my feet wet into SPELs (LISP Macros)
  - Got distracted so not as much progress as I would've liked but baby steps I guess
